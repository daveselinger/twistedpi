# twistedpi
A python framework for controlling raspberry pi GPIO as a server

Please note that I'm a new Python/Twisted programmer, so all feedback is welcome!

The inspiration for this is essentially a very simple Wi-Fi based remote control for different motor/sensor based capabilities for the Raspberry Pi.

Certainly 100% of this functionality could be accomplished using SSH, but I wanted to design something for which a dumb client (HTML, simple sockets) could control all of the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. Initially I built this to control a simple 2-motor, 1-servo remote controlled robot.
